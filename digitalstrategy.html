           <p>Lawsuits, crime, death, sports, business, performances, culture, music, COVID-19, the 2020 election. You name it, I've covered it in my experience writing social media copy as a digital content intern at INDY Week and as the audience engagement editor of The Daily Tar Heel.
            <br><br>In my work with social media strategy, I've found that effectively promoting journalism on digital platforms requires the following:</p>
            <ul class="digitalstrategypoints">
                <li>Knowing which audiences you're targeting on each platform, then <b>tailoring content to maximize their engagement</b>—keeping in mind that different details, different quotes and different styles of writing will resonate with different audiences
                </li>
                <li>Incorporating the <b>curiosity gap</b>: Sharing enough information about the story to compel users to click the link and read the article, while not giving away the whole story
                </li>
                <li>Creating content with a <b>user-first perspective</b> ("What do I need to write in this social media post in order to make a user want to stop scrolling through their feed and engage with this article?" Maybe it'll take a compelling detail that isn’t present in the headline; or a short, powerful quote; or a narrative that will draw readers in
                    )
                </li>
                <li>Making decisions using <b>strong news judgment</b> (What qualifies as "BREAKING," and what doesn't? Which stories should be promoted on each platform and how often? Do I "tag" this organization/public figure or not? How do I balance my obligation to fairly represent competing voices in a story without falling into the trap of "both-sides-ism"?)
                </li>
                <li>Operating with the <b>highest standard of professionalism.</b> Taking the utmost care in deciding what to retweet and like, how to respond to criticism, whom to follow—knowing that the actions of social media accounts reflect on the whole newsroom and affect readers
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below is social media content that I've written or edited with these principles in mind. (Note: Some of this content uses or adapts language written by the reporter in the corresponding article.) In addition, I am including one of the newsletters I've written and curated for The Daily Tar Heel.</p>
